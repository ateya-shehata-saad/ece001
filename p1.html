 The term <strong>“Cloud Computing”</strong> appeared in 
1997 in a seminar given by Ramnath Chellappa.The 
concept was already associated with John McCarthy, 
creator of LISP programming language and a pioneer 
in Artificial Intelligence technology. And the 
emergence of many forms and possibilities updated 
and all this for the purpose of benefiting the human 
being, through which it is easy to communicate and 
some work based on it and other things. Figure 1 is an example of mobile 
Computing. Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and 
mobile software. Communication issues include ad hoc networks and infrastructure networks 
as well as communication properties, protocols, data formats and concrete technologies. 
Hardware includes mobile devices or device components. Mobile software deals with the 
characteristics and requirements of mobile applications.</p>
